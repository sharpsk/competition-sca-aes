# Bit by Bit Side Channel Hackathon 2025  
## AES Key Recovery via Side Channel Analysis

This repository contains our submission for the **Bit by Bit Side Channel Hackathon 2025**.  
We tackled two problems involving side-channel analysis of AES encryption.  

Our approaches were based primarily on **Correlation Power Analysis (CPA)** with minimal preprocessing (Problem 1) and extended preprocessing pipelines (Problem 2).

## Problems Overview

### üîπ Problem 1 ‚Äî Simulated AES Power Traces
- Dataset: 5,000 traces (ciphertext + simulated power values)  
- Approach: CPA with Hamming Weight leakage model  
- Result: **‚úÖ Successfully recovered AES-128 key**  
- See [`problem1/README.md`](./problem1/README.md) for details

### üîπ Problem 2 ‚Äî Real AES Power Traces
- Dataset: Real measured traces (plaintext + ciphertext + power samples)  
- Approach: Preprocessing (alignment, normalization, denoising) + CPA  
- Result: **‚ùå Key recovery unsuccessful** (candidate keys derived but mismatched)  
- See [`problem2/README.md`](./problem2/README.md) for details
